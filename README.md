# afa-ini# Build a simple Score Application.

A simple Web App to score a users signup information. Details:
Build a signup form that accepts:
- Name, email (unique), age, occupation, currently employed, address, how ManyYearsEmployed (use any data types of your choosing for the fields.)
- Perform Form Validation, Required fields include name and email
- You are to assume other fields as optional fields. Score the form information based on the existence and characteristics of the optional fields.

### Explanation:

Optional Fields (which include age, occupation, address etc.) are to each be assigned weights which make up to a total of 10.

<br>

Example: if no age - score of 0, if no address score of 0. If how ManyYearsEmployed < 1 score can be enumerated.
**Hint:** Enumerate values for yearsOfEmployment.

_N.B_

A Required validation, if Age is less than 18 total weight should be 0.

- 1 for the signup
